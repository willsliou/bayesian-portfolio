# Portfolio Management and Analysis

## Overview
A portfolio management framework using Python integrating risk and return analysis, dynamic optimization techniques, and macroeconomic insights.

---

## Key Features
1. **Portfolio Analysis**
   - Calculate key metrics: expected return, volatility, Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio, beta, alpha.
   - Analyze portfolio covariance, risk contributions, and diversification.

2. **Risk Metrics**
   - Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional VaR (CVaR) using historical and Monte Carlo methods.
   - Tail-risk metrics: Skewness, Kurtosis, and stress testing.

3. **Optimization Techniques**
   - Mean-variance optimization.
   - Risk parity for equalized risk contributions.
   - Black-Litterman model for incorporating subjective views.

4. **Performance Attribution**
   - Benchmark comparison: tracking error and information ratio.
   - Factor analysis: size, value, momentum, and macroeconomic factors.

5. **Dynamic Allocation Strategies**
   - Rules-based rebalancing (threshold, momentum-based).
   - Adaptive strategies using macroeconomic data.

6. **Predictive Analytics**
   - Time-series forecasting for returns using machine learning.
   - Macro factor-driven predictions.

7. **Interactive Dashboard**
   - Visualize portfolio performance, risk contributions, and return attribution.
   - Adjust allocations dynamically using interactive sliders.

8. **Macroeconomic Integration**
   - Incorporate real-world data (e.g., interest rates, GDP growth) for realistic simulations.
   - Analyze the impact of economic conditions on asset performance.

### **Things to note**

1. Incorporates covariance, VaR, and alpha, factor analysis and stress testing.
2. Tries to ties theory to real-world applications, including dynamic rebalancing and macroeconomic integration.
